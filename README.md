# The Settlers 4 Gold Edition: DisableIntros Plugin

This plugin was made to prevent intro videos from playing during game startup.  
Disabling intro movies will wastly speed up time for the game to launch and fix graphical issues with video playing (e.g: resized program windows on your desktop).  

**NOTE!** This plugin works only with The Settlers 4 Gold Edition (GoG version)

## How to use

You need an ASI Loader to use this mod. I recommend [The Settlers 4: ASI Loader](https://github.com/nyfrk/Settlers4-ASI-Loader) as it works nicely with the Gold and History Edition of The Settlers 4 and does not require any configuration. 

1. [Download](https://github.com/Patrix9999/Settlers4-DisableIntros/releases) a release.
2. Unpack the files into your `plugins` directory.
3. Start the game. The mod will load automatically.

To uninstall the mod remove `DisableIntros.asi` from your`plugins` directory.

Compile it yourself
Download Visual Studio 2017 or 2019 with the C++ toolchain. The project is configured to build it with the Windows 10 compatible v143 toolchain. However, you should be able to change the toolchain to whatever you like. No additional libraries are required so it should compile out of the box.
